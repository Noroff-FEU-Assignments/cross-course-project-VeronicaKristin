    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advice them to use continuous deployment/continuous integration since this is a automatic process and it runs every change against some security checks. I would also advice them to use a secure authentication protocoll or framework. and implement automatic user timeout so that the credentials of people that forget to sign out dont get stolen.  </p>
